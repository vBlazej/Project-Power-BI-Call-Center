## Problem Statement
In this project, I am the newly employed data analyst for call center.

The call center is plagued by inefficiencies, leading to high call abandonment rates and customer dissatisfaction. Long wait times, delays in connecting with agents, and difficulty resolving issues frustrate callers, resulting in missed service opportunities and potential customer churn.

## Questions

 * What is the total number of calls on each day over a specified time period.
 * What is the total number of calls received from different states or regions.
 * How the number of reports is distributed across the states.
 * What is the distribution of calls by different communication channels.
 * What is the distribution of calls by opinion.
 * What is the total number of calls handled by each call center or department.
